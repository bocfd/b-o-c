Feedback vs Delusion: what’s actually breaking

This is a living draft. Older versions will move to the archive. Open to good-faith dialogue.

  “Living successfully in a world of systems requires more of us than an ability to calculate. It requires our full humanity — our rationality, our ability to sort out truth from falsehood, our intuition, our compassion, our vision, and our morality.”
-Donella Meadows

If you feel something is fundamentally off in modern life but every explanation feels like it is missing the real cause, you are not wrong. The symptoms are obvious:

• Prices drift away from wages and work.
• Institutions repeat the language of accountability while answering to no one.
• Culture fragments into noise and attention feels purchased instead of earned.

The system still moves, but it no longer feels. The sensation was removed.

Not by accident, and not by ideology, but because three core feedback loops were cut.

1. Money stopped being a signal and became a simulation.

  “When credit creates money, it destroys the very measure by which value is known.”
-Jacques Rueff

Money once recorded stored work. Now it is created first through credit, and reality is asked to catch up later. Prices no longer track real conditions, they track liquidity.

Home prices rise forty percent in three years while wages rise four percent. The homes did not improve, the credit supply did.

When money loses contact with production, everything downstream—wages, rents, savings, and risk—becomes distorted.

2. Institutions stopped feeling the people they govern.

  “There is no reason to believe that bureaucrats and politicians, no matter how well meaning, are better at solving problems than the people on the spot.”
-Elinor Ostrom

Institutions still use the grammar of service, but they only respond to what their machinery can detect: metrics, liability models, donor networks, compliance layers.

A public hearing is held for “community input” after the funding contract was already approved two fiscal cycles earlier.

Government is not the brain of society.
It is an appendage that has lost sensation.

3. Meaning stopped being produced socially and started being broadcast commercially.

  “The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country.”
-Edward Bernays

Attention once followed relevance, what mattered to your work, your place, your people. Now it follows incentive. Whoever can buy attention decides what matters.

The most viral “grassroots” cultural trend of the week is owned by two IP holding companies operating five hundred influencer accounts.

When meaning is manufactured instead of discovered, identity becomes programmable.
  

The real divide:

The axis is not left versus right, public versus private, capitalism versus socialism.

The axis is feedback versus distance, how far a decision is from the cost of its outcome.

The farther power is from consequence, the more delusional it becomes.

That is why the same patterns appear across every sector:

• Asset prices float above labor.
• Elections register preference but do not change direction.
• Institutions perfect accountability theater while remaining immune to consequence.
• Workers know the trap but remain tied to it through insurance and dependency.
• Cultural frustration has no route back into participation, so it vents into brands and blame.

When feedback is bypassed, intelligence shuts down.
Not because people become less intelligent, but because the system stops feeling what it governs.

  “Every response, whether it be an act directed towards the outside world or an act internalized as thought, takes the form of an adaptation, or better, of a re-adaptation.”
-Jean Piaget

Intelligence is not a trait.
It is a function of contact.

Field Guide: how to tell if a system still works.

Ask three questions:

Does money reflect real production?

Do institutions feel the cost of their decisions?

Does meaning emerge from life, or get broadcast from above?

If the answer to any of these is no, you are not dealing with a broken system.
You are dealing with a numb one.

Repair is not ideological. It is mechanical.

Shorten the loop.

• Put money back in contact with production.
• Put governance back in contact with consequence.
• Put meaning back in contact with lived experience.

Wherever feedback still exists —real work, real enterprise, real skills, real places— the nervous system of civilization is still alive.

A system without sensation cannot learn.
A civilization without feedback cannot stay sane.

If this resonates, you are already part of the repair crew.
