# B-o-C

Exploring how feedback shapes systems, and what happens when governance is insulated from feedback.

## Overview

This repository is a working space for developing the core ideas behind the framework. The project examines how feedback maintains coherence in living systems, and how breakdowns in feedback affect communities, institutions, and large-scale governance structures.

The goal is not to write a manifesto, but to build a clear, testable model of how social systems stay aligned with the people they serve — and what happens when they don’t.

## Structure

- `primer.md` – Short, readable summary for public posts (Reddit, blogs, etc.)
- `notes/` – Drafts, fragments, working thoughts
- `archive/` – Old versions kept for reference
- `diagrams/` – Visual models as they develop

More structure will evolve as the project grows.

## Contributing

This is an open exploratory project. Suggestions, critiques, and pull requests are welcome as long as they aim to clarify, not distort, the core ideas.
