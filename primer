This project starts from a core premise:

Society is a living system, made of nested living systems. They don’t go backward in development, but they can lose functional capacity when feedback breaks down.

A person never becomes a child again, but they can lose agency, awareness, or coherence. Institutions and civilizations follow the same pattern.

Every living system develops through feedback. The signals that reach it most strongly shape its priorities, structure, and sense of reality. When feedback moves freely, errors self-correct, pressure releases, and the system stays aligned across its layers.

Governance doesn’t respond to “the people” in the abstract. It responds to whoever can project the strongest signals. When signal power becomes uneven, the governing layer grows insulated, and feedback gets blocked, delayed, or rerouted through abstractions that no longer carry lived reality.

When feedback is insulated, a spiral begins:

1. The layer closest to governance starts to lose contact with lived conditions.  
2. It stops feeling the full reality of what it manages.  
3. The further layers adapt to conditions the closer layer no longer perceives.  
4. The closer layer adapts only to the signals still reaching it.   
5. Which increases the distance between layers and weakens feedback further.  

As this loop runs, the system doesn’t collapse —it drifts. It can tighten inward around the insulated layer or drift outward into fragmentation, depending on what signals stay close and what gets filtered out.

This isn’t about villains or conspiracies. It’s structural: when feedback narrows, delusion concentrates, and disconnection spreads.

The goal of this work is to map that process clearly enough that it can be recognized, discussed, and acted on — in communities, in governance, and in any system that claims to serve others.

This repo is where the model is being shaped into its public form. It will keep evolving as real feedback comes in.
